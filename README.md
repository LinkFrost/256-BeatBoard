# 256-BeatBoard

## Overview

Created for CICS 256 at UMass Amherst, this project involved creating an interactive piano that has song recording capabilities. This was created using a custom ESP32 "MakerBoard" which runs an Arduino script, and this board was connected to an array of buttons that act as piano keys, a passive piezo buzzer for sound output, and outputs information to the board's OLED screen and NeoPixelRing.
